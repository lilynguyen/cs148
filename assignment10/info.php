<h1>What is Tea?</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>Tea is made from the single plant <i>Camelia Sinensis</i> branching into over 200 species around the world.
	They grow in different climates and different elevations. They're stored in airtight containers or exposed
	discs of themselves. Truly it's amazing that the tea you drink at home is the same as the tea served in a
	traditional Japanese ceremony -- just prepared a little differently.</p><br>

<h1>Types of Tea</h1>
<table>
	<tr><td id='pic'><img src='images/green.jpg' alt='green tea'></td>
		<td>Green tea is the most popular type of tea of all variations. It originated in China, but 
			is production today is widespread in most all countries of Asia. Green tea is riddled with
			health benefits including lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and lower LDL 
			cholesterol.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td id='pic'><img src='images/black.jpg' alt='black tea'></td>
		<td>Black tea is another common tea type. It's typically more rich and strong in flavor compared
			to others. It retains its flavor after many years in storage compared to green. Black tea
			accounts for over ninty percent of all tea sold in the West.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td id='pic'><img src='images/white.jpg' alt='white tea'></td>
		<td>White tea's name derives from it's apparent silvery-white hairs. The tea itself, however, is
			a more pale yellow and light in taste compared to other teas.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td id='pic'><img src='images/oolong.jpg' alt='oolong tea'></td>
		<td>Oolong tea is very similar to green tea in taste with a little more aroma. It has a much more
			complex preparation procedure than green, however. Oolong comes rolled into long curly leaves
			or into small beads.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td id='pic'><img src='images/yellow.jpg' alt='yellow tea'></td>
		<td>Yellow tea is the rarest and most expensive variety of tea. It's prepared similarly to green
			tea, however it is steamed under a damp cloth, giving it its nice yellow color.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td id='pic'><img src='images/red.jpg' alt='red tea'></td>
		<td>Unlike all other teas, red tea, also known as Rooibos, is made from an african tree root, giving
			it its earthy, rich, "red" flavor. Typically its appearance is coarse and red -- similar to
			fine hairs. Rooibos is one of few tea types that can be prepared similar to espresso when ground
			fine.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td id='pic'><img src='images/puer.jpg' alt='puer tea'></td>
		<td>Puer is a very aged and fermented dark tea most similar to black tea. It comes typically in a
			disc or ball -- exposed to the air as opposed to being sealed in airtight containers. One
			consumes puer by breaking pieces off of the shape. It has a distinct taste to it.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr><td id='pic'><img src='images/herbal.jpg' alt='herbal tea'></td>
		<td>Herbal tea is also unlike normal teas in that it's typically made up of other herbs or spices
			not neccessarily inclusive of the Camellia Sinensis. Herbal teas also typically don't contain
			any caffeine which proves to be a leading attribute in its popularity. Herbel teas are able
			to take on many more flavor profiles than the normal tea variety can due to the diversity of
			herbs and spices as well as flowers and fruits that could be added to a specific herbal blend.</td>
